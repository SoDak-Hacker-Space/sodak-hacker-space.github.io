Hello! My name is alex. I'm a security professional with a special interest in offensive security, Linux systems, automations, and infrastructure as code (IaC). In addition to those primary interests, I have a desire to learn more about AI, game development, cloud infrastructure, hardware hacking, and the BSD operating system.<br><br>


If you're interested in what I'm working on outside of the hackerspace, I do have a personal website where I write on what I'm studying and working on in my homelab. You can find that link below as well as my personal GitHub.
